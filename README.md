# Empire : The Uprising
This is the documentation for the very first game in the series 'Empire'. I am the game's sole designer and coder.

My Github name is TheRealFury and I had the original inspiration for this game series which I have named 'Empire' whlie I was trying to create a game of my own. This game was originally implemented in VBA but I later moved on to JS. This file was first announed to the public in it's present JS form that was coded on [this platform](https://studio.code.org/home).
